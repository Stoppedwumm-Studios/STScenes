# Mixed Scenes
Maybe you need this scene manager only for events

Then you're lucky because I wrote it so that you can use them for events

## How
Drop the objects you want to load in into a scene (see <https://stoppedwumm-studios.github.io/STScenes/tutorial>) and call it a scene, if it gets loaded in or changed, the map that isn't dropped in will be always loaded in.

## Does this work with Audio Scenes
Yes, when switching scenes, no Audio that was in the SoundService before gets deleted
